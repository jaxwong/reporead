# RepoRead — Feature List and Delivery Scope

This is the scope and priority checklist. User value and acceptance criteria live in [user stories](reporead-user-stories.md); technical behavior and ownership live in the [implementation spec](reporead-product-engineering-spec.md). An item appearing here does not authorize a broader implementation than its linked story.

## MVP features

| ID | Feature | User stories | Delivery milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-01 | GitHub sign-in, read-only connection, and selection of one or more repositories | US-01, US-11 | 1 — Read |
| F-02 | Markdown discovery and folder/note browsing | US-01, US-02 | 1 — Read |
| F-03 | Android mobile reader for GitHub-flavored Markdown | US-03 | 1 — Read |
| F-04 | Fenced code syntax highlighting and safe Mermaid rendering | US-03 | 1 — Read |
| F-05 | Local cache for previously opened notes and offline reading | US-06 | 1 — Read |
| F-06 | Semantic reading progress, bookmarks, and Continue Reading | US-02, US-04 | 2 — Remember |
| F-07 | Highlights and textual annotations stored outside Markdown | US-05 | 2 — Remember |
| F-08 | Offline annotation mutation persistence and idempotent sync | US-06 | 2 — Remember |
| F-09 | Source-version tracking, file-move recognition, and conservative annotation re-anchoring | US-07, US-08 | 3 — Survive edits |
| F-10 | Orphan state with original context and manual reattachment | US-07 | 3 — Survive edits |
| F-11 | Recently changed notes and section-level “changed since last read” | US-02, US-09 | 4 — Git-aware reading |
| F-12 | Basic search over cached note titles and content | US-10 | MVP; schedule after core reading path |
| F-13 | Repository disconnect and account-deletion path | US-11 | MVP; before external use |

Annotation-text conflict handling and the privacy/security requirements in the implementation spec apply throughout the MVP, even where they are not separate UI features.

## Delivery milestones

### 1 — Read

Build the Spring Boot backend and Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Android app; connect a GitHub repository; list Markdown files; render technical Markdown, code, and Mermaid; cache opened notes with Room. Install on a physical Android phone, by development install or signed APK—Google Play publication is not needed.

**Evidence:** The developer prefers RepoRead to GitHub Mobile for reading their own notes.

### 2 — Remember

Add reading progress, bookmarks, highlights, annotations, and pending offline mutations. Reading actions must leave source Markdown untouched.

**Evidence:** The developer can read for a week and reliably resume and retrieve annotations.

### 3 — Survive edits

Track Git versions; resolve exact/context anchors; conservatively handle fuzzy matches; show orphaned annotations and support manual reattachment. Recognize safe file moves.

**Evidence:** Common edits neither destroy annotations nor move them to an incorrect passage.

### 4 — Git-aware reading

Add recently changed notes and section-level changes since the last-read version.

**Evidence:** The developer can go directly to material changed since the previous study session.

### 5 — Polish and demonstrate

Add integration coverage, metrics, architecture decision records, security review, and failure/offline demonstrations. Provide a documented local demo setup using explicitly labeled fixtures; do not treat demo data as evidence of real GitHub integration.

**Evidence:** The product can be demonstrated without depending on a live GitHub response, and the real integration has been verified separately.

## Explicitly out of MVP

- Markdown authoring, WYSIWYG editing, Git commits, pull requests, or comments written back to GitHub.
- Collaboration, public profiles, or team knowledge management.
- AI summaries, chat with notes, or spaced-repetition flashcards.
- Other Git providers, arbitrary binary formats, and rich drawing/canvas tools.
- iOS, Google Play distribution, and optional LaTeX/math rendering.
- Webhook-triggered sync, AST-aware diffing, and Elasticsearch unless later evidence warrants them.

These are exclusions, not hidden stretch goals. Revisit only after the Android reading workflow is genuinely useful.

## Personal-project definition of done

1. At least one real personal GitHub notes repository is connected.
2. A signed APK is installed on the developer's physical Android phone without Google Play.
3. The Kotlin/Compose client uses the real Spring Boot backend.
4. The developer voluntarily uses RepoRead for at least two weeks.
5. Mermaid renders correctly and reading position reliably resumes.
6. At least 20 real highlights or annotations are created; source Markdown remains untouched.
7. A real note edit exercises re-anchoring without silently misplacing an annotation.
8. Offline reading and annotation work, including synchronization after reconnect.
9. A laptop edit appears in the mobile changed-since-last-read workflow.
10. Backend integration tests run against PostgreSQL; important decisions are documented as ADRs.
11. A local demo can run with clearly labeled fixtures if GitHub is unavailable.

## Demo evidence and interview focus

A short demo should show the same note in GitHub Mobile and RepoRead; folder browsing; Markdown, code, and Mermaid; a new annotation without a source-file change; re-anchoring after a real edit; an orphan after an ambiguous rewrite; changed-since-last-read; and offline annotation followed by one successful sync. Then show the GitHub/source, Spring Boot/durable state, and Room/offline-cache boundaries.

The most useful code and tests to show are anchor resolution, incremental sync, idempotent mutation handling, optimistic annotation updates, GitHub permission and token handling, safe rendering, and annotation-survival integration tests—not generic CRUD. Be ready to explain why GitHub remains canonical, why a backend is needed, how duplicates, moves, force-pushes, conflicts, malicious Markdown, and GitHub outages are handled, what would fail at much larger scale, and what was deliberately not built.
